# Welcome to StupidAI's project: MineAdventure!

### What is MineAdventure?
The project is going to be an adventure game for our Minecraft agent. 
In the project, there will be a randomly generated adventure map for our agent, the goal of our agent is 
to leave this “dangerous” area as soon as possible while our agent is alive, in other words, our agent should 
use AI/ML algorithms to find the best way to leave this map(arrive at destination). We defined the best way 
as the shortest path from start point to end point while the agent is alive.

### Want to see how does the internal algorithms work?
